This project implements a solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a hybrid algorithm that combines
a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) with a Nearest Neighbor (NN) search. The algorithm aims to find a good approximation
of the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting point.
